goal - detect if the system will fail in the next 30 days 

outcome - the system is down due to some unplanned reasons

signals - latency

Assumption - system ususally crash when the latency is higher then normal

rule - if the latency > 500ms, pause and intervene

boundary - if all the other physical signals like RAM, db, etc are normal and all the non physical signals  like traffic, network, etc are also normal, then only the Assumption holds
