a model needs to predict will the system fail in the next 30 days

failure can be so many thing and it can be context dependent. I am assuming failure here means system gone down 

1. Outcome (Target)
    system failed but model missed predicts healthy

2. Signal
    the latency increases and system starts to become unusable 

3. Assumption
    if system is healthy, latency is controlled, maintained and below a certain threshold

4. Risk
    if latency of respose > 500ms, temporarily halt the system to inspect 
    (here this can occur in high traffic situations but then we add servers)

5. Boundary
    the model's response is only valid for the failures that it's been trained on
