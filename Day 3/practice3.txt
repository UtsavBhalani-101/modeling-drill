1. Outcome (Target)
    the system failed due to an unplanned reason 

2. Signal
    if system is normal, latency doesn't increase beyond a certain normal threshold

3. Assumption
    system usually crashes if latency is higher then normal 

4. Rule
    if latency > 500 ms, intervene and inspect the system

5. Boundary
    if latency higher then normal but system is working normally and no lags, don't pause the system
