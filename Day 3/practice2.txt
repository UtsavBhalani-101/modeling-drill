1. Outcome (Target)
    the system failed due to some unexpected reason 

2. Signal
    the latency increases and system starts to become unusable 

3. Assumption
    if system is healthy, latency is controlled, maintained and below a certain threshold

4. Risk
    if latency of respose > 500ms, temporarily halt the system to inspect 
    (here this can occur in high traffic situations but then we add servers)

5. Boundary
    the model's response is only valid for the failures that it's been trained on
