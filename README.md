## modeling drill

## ⚠️ WARNING: This is a "Learning in Public" repository.

This repo contains raw drills, failed experiments, and "scratchpad" code as I build my ML Diagnostic System.

Expect: Broken code, unoptimized loops, and half-finished thoughts.

Do Not Expect: Production-ready libraries (Go to my ml-diagnostics repo for that).
