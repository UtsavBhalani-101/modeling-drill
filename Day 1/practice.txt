target = it gives the probability of failure of sys in the next month. if the probability is >0.6 for the 
        failure, then stop the sys, run a detailed inspection on sys and try to find the bottleneck

inputs = 
        1. system's current and past activity and behavior
        2. timelines of failues in the past
        3. causes of failures in the past
        4. performace of harware along with system - are they both stable, is one of them unusually high or low ?
        5. updates in the code (this can lead to security risks if not properly checked)
        6. is the latency of system >0.1ms

model logic:
            I assume the inputs are addative + threshold. each of these inputs have a threshold, 
            if it get's crossed, it's in the danger zone where the system could fail and if multiple 
            inputs cross the danger zone, it's Dday. stop the sys and find these issues
