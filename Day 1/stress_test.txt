assumption = “Past failure causes are representative of future failures.”

rewritten -
             > 90% of the future and present failures are caused by same reasons it happened in Past

data -
        for this assumption I need all the failure_causes that happened in the recorded data that is being
        fed 

test -
        take the data of the days when system crashed for the first 100 failures
        now check if the causes are actually similar or not

        and do the same for the last 100 failures and check if the failure_causes
        align with the first 100 

what could be wrong -
                    if > 80% failure_causes are not repeated then the assumption is FALSE 

consequences - 
                if my assumption fails then essentially each failure is almost a new failure and 
                system is enable to detect it. What I can do is have a safety net that acts like a 
                really sensitive alarm and if even the slightest way the system is performing weirdly,
                flag this and call authorities
